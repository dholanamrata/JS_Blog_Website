        <p>Foreground and background separation had always been a huge problem before the onset of object detection
            based neural networks. Techniques from image processing like color based segmentation, depth based
            segmentation and other traditional techniques had to be used. Today with the help of , off the shelf deep
            learning models, its become very easy to mask region of interest and separate foreground from background.
        </p>

        <h2>Applications :-</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Portrait Mode with Deep Learning</li>
            <li>Background blur on video calls while working from home</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Portrait Mode with Deep Learning</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Portrait mode became famous when images were captured from DSLR cameras. High end DSLR cameras have an option
            to reduce the focal length on the camera to make sure the camera can capture images with major focus on the
            small distance objects in a scene and automatically blurring the background. Such images became very famous
            as it automatically sharpens the subject/object infront of the camera.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This trend continued by adding two cameras to smart phones, to capture depth information. Based on depth
            threshold, segmenting region of interest was very easy. Portrait mode started trending on mobile phones
            because of dual cameras that can give depth information.</p>
        <br>
        <p>With the popularity of object detection based networks, portrait mode was possible without high end DSLR or
            dual cameras.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Lets learn how portrait mode works without dual camera or high end DSLR.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>First you need a good camera and subject. Capture an image which is well focused without any distortion
                or evident noise.</li>
            <li>Get the image and pass it through an object detection network and get the output foreground boundary
                from the region proposal network.</li>
            <li>Separate the foreground and background as two separate images.
            <li>Blur the background and sharpen the foreground.</li>
            </li>
        </ol>
