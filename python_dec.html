        <p>Ever wanted to create a Python library, albeit for your team at work or for some open source project online?
            In this blog you will learn how to!</p><br>
        <p>The tutorial is easiest to follow when you are using the same tools, however it is also possible for you to
            use different ones.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The tools used in this tutorial are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>- Linux command prompt</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>- Visual Studio Code</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Step 1: Create a directory in which you want to put your library</h3>
        <p>Open your command prompt and create a folder in which you will create your Python library.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Remember:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>- With pwd you can see your present working directory.</li>
            <li>- With ls you can list the folders and files in your directory.</li>
            <li>- With cd <path> you can change the current present directory you are in.</li>
            <li>- With mkdir <folder> you can create a new folder in your working directory.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Step 2: Create a virtual environment for your folder</h3>
        <p>When starting your project, it is always a good idea to create a virtual environment to encapsulate your
            project. A virtual environment consists of a certain Python version and some libraries.

            Virtual environments prevent the issue of running into dependency issues later on. For example, in older
            projects you might have worked with older versions of the numpy library. Some old code, that once worked
            beautifully, might stop working once you update its version. Perhaps parts of numpy are no longer compatible
            with other parts of your program. Creating virtual environments prevents this. They are also useful in cases
            when you are collaborating with someone else, and you want to make sure that your application is working on
            their computer, and vice versa.</p>
